# imc_calc

A IMC Calculator built with Flutter using multiple state management solutions, as follow:

- setState
- ValueNotifier
- ChangeNotifier
- Bloc Pattern (Streams)

This project was made following some classes of [Rodrigo Rahman's Flutter Academy course](https://academiadoflutter.com.br),
but with personal modifications.


## Supported platforms

- android
- web
- linux

Should work in windows, mac and ios but I don't have tested yet.
